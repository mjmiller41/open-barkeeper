    "description": "Baileys Irish Cream really is a simple combination of cream, Irish whisky, and (as they say on their website) \"other flavors\". Those other flavors are hints of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and Almond. Yes, you read that right, ALMOND. Adding just a touch of almond extract takes this home recipe and makes it indistinguishable from the store bought version. ",
